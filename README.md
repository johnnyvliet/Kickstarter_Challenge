# Kickstarter_Challenge
## **Overview of Project**
The purpose of this project is to help Louise see how the success of certain campaigns outcomes vary by time of year and the goal amounts. There are tables, sumized data and visualizations to help show our findings. You can view the spreadsheet and understand the codes we used by clicking this link [Kickstarter_Challenge]("C:\Users\jvanv\OneDrive\Desktop\Classwork Folder\Crowdfunding Analysis\Kickstarter-Challenge.xlsx")---

## **Analysis and Challenges*
- To determine how time of year affects theatre campaign outcomes, we created a pivot table filtering for Theatre campaigns and years. Placing outcomes in columns and months of the year as the rows, we were able to count the amount of successful, failed and canceled campaigns for each month in a given year. The chart linked below shows that theatre campaings in May and June are the most successful ![Theatre_Outcomes_vs_Launch]("C:\Users\jvanv\OneDrive\Desktop\Classwork Folder\Crowdfunding Analysis\Challenge Pictures\Theatre_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png").---

- To find the number of successful,failed, and canceled Play outcomes based on goal amounts, we derived an equation that could count the outcomes of each play campaign by goal amount thresholds. To summarize the data, we took the averages of the outcomes at each goal amount. Using these data points, we created a line graph to visually show how the goal amounts influences the percentage of outcomes ![Outcomes_vs_Goals]("C:\Users\jvanv\OneDrive\Desktop\Classwork Folder\Crowdfunding Analysis\Challenge Pictures\Outcomes_vs_Goals.png")---
- A couple challenges that were encountered included building a complicated COUNTIF statement and building the pivot table to accurately calculate the information we were looking for. The COUNTIF function was used to find the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns by goal amount. It required that we include the appropriate column in our data, as well as manually enter the outcome and goal amount thresholds. This had to be repeated for each cell in the table. The pivot table, as mentioned earlier, was used to find theatre outcomes by month. Excel automatically input quarters as the unit of time when filtering the table by year. This required us to manually alter the formula to change the table rows to show months.---

## **Results**
1. There are two conclusions we can draw about outcomes based on launch date. The first is that the best time of year to launch a campaign is May and June. We found these months had the highest number of successful campaigns. The second is that December is the worst time. Opposite of May and June, we found that December had the lowest number of successful campaigns---
2. Based on our findings of outcomes based on goal amounts, we conclude that campaigns with goals between $45,000 and $49,999 will almost certainly fail. At these values, the percentage of failed campaigns skyrockets, while the percentage of successful campaigns plummets.---
3. It's important to realize some limitations. One of which is that our results don't factor in the country the campaign was held. Including this may shed light on different prefernces and demographics. Another limitation is that the goal amounts table does not include the amount of backers. For example, if a campaign with a goal of $30,000 and 10 backers failed, while a campaign with the same goal succeeded with 100 backers, we could better see the influence of backers and not simlpy if a campaign succeeded or failed.---
4. Twhere are two further tables that might be useful for further analysis, and would eliminate the aformentioned limitations. One would be a success rate by month in each country table, this would help understand if there are better times to launch a campaign in different countries. Another table to create would be successful campaigns by goal amount and number of backers. This would show on average how many backers are required to achieve success.
